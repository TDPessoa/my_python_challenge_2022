# Python Challenge 2022

    I challenged myself to collect all the scripts I've written since \
    2019, to organize and update, documenting the process on GitHub.  \
    Despite having been writing in python for almost three years, I   \
    haven't participated in any projects or had any experience with   \
    anything remotely close to one. The longest script I've written   \
    so far was 140 lines long and even then, half of it was comments.

    I discovered Python at my college and I really enjoyed the first  \
    steps with algorithms, I took some courses but the idea of making \
    a program with thousands of lines of text is still something that \
    I can barely see on my horizon, I confess that it discouraged me, \
    however, I have aspirations to do postgraduate work in some area  \
    related to software, so programming is something I never want to  \
    give up. That's why the idea of doing this challenge came up. I   \
    will challenge myself to do better, put my knowledge into         \
    practice and, at the same time, create a 'semi-portfolio' since   \
    at the moment I don't have any.

    Even in this README.md, I will "structure" something like py and  \
    try to be as close to what I understand as best practices for     \
    anything within this repository.

    Inside changelog.md I will document all the changes I made to     \
    each file.
